## ⚠️ Project Status

This game was developed as a final course project under a tight deadline.  
Some features were left incomplete due to time constraints:

- ❌ No tutorial  
- ❌ No final scene or game ending  
- ✅ Core puzzle mechanics implemented  
- ✅ Functional peer-to-peer online connection

Despite being unfinished, the project showcases the core gameplay loop and cooperative mechanics we aimed to build.
